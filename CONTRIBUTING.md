# Contribute to ML4Fires ðŸ”¥

[scikit-learn guide to contributing](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Ways to contribute

## Fixing outstanding issues

## Submitting a bug-related issue or feature request

### Did you find a bug?

The ML4Fires ðŸ”¥ library is robust and reliable thanks to users who report the problems they encounter.

Before you report an issue, we would really appreciate it if you could **make sure the bug was not
already reported** (use the search bar on GitHub under Issues). 
Your issue should also be related to bugs in the library itself, and not your code.

Once you've confirmed the bug hasn't already been reported, please include the following information in your issue so we can quickly resolve it:

* Your **OS type and version** and **Python**, **PyTorch** and
  **TensorFlow** versions when applicable.
* A short, self-contained, code snippet that allows us to reproduce the bug in
  less than 30s.
* The *full* traceback if an exception is raised.
* Attach any other additional information, like screenshots, you think may help.

### Do you want a new feature?

If there is a new feature you'd like to see in ML4Fires ðŸ”¥, please open an issue and describe:

1. What is the *motivation* behind this feature? Is it related to a problem or frustration with the library? Is it a feature related to something you need for a project? Is it something you worked on and think it could benefit the community?
2. Describe your requested feature in as much detail as possible. The more you can tell us about it, the better we'll be able to help you.
3. Provide a *code snippet* that demonstrates the features usage.
4. If the feature is related to a paper, please include a link.

If your issue is well written we're already 80% of the way there by the time you create it.

## Do you want to implement a new model?

If you want to implement a new model, please provide the following information:

* A short description of the model and a link to the paper.
* Link to the implementation if it is open-sourced.
* Link to the model weights if they are available.

If you are willing to contribute the model yourself, let us know so we can help you add it to ML4Fires ðŸ”¥!

## Do you want to add documentation?

We're always looking for improvements to the documentation that make it more clear and accurate. Please let us know how the documentation can be improved such as typos and any content that is missing, unclear or inaccurate. We'll be happy to make the changes or help you make a contribution if you're interested!
